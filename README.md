Musical Structure App
====

### Project Overview
This project is a chance for you to combine and practice everything you learned in this section of the Nanodegree program. You will be making the structure of a music app using intents and empty activities.

The goal is to design and create the structure of a Music app which would allow a user to play audio files. 

### Why this project?
In the most recent portion of the Nanodegree program, you learned how to think about the structure of an app and how to use OnClickListeners and explicit Intents to link between different activities within your own app.

### What will I learn?
This project is about combining various ideas and skills weâ€™ve been practicing throughout the course. They include:

* Designing an app experience to achieve a certain goal
* Creating new activities
* Using explicit Intents to link between activities in your app.
* Using OnClickListeners to add behavior to buttons using Java code.
